# Desktop-deer
This is a program that puts a deer on your desktop written in java. To relocate the deer, click on the dear, then move your mouse to where you want it to go to and click the home key on your keyboard.

<b> Note you have to go in to deer.java and add some .wav files for the sounds if you click on it or remove that code. This program only works on one monitor. </b>
